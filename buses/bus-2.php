                                    looks for a catwalk to showcase their skills.</p><br>
								<b>Hair and Makeup:</b>
								<p>Hairdressing students are experiencing a real life opportunity to collaborate with other departments and complete a session styling event. Through collaboration and research the students are also gaining new skills. Communication has been key to maintain a timeline of planning and development.</p>

								<b>Fashion:</b>
                                <p>Fashion students have been asked to design a promotional and 'Ready to Wear' range based on a concept developed in 
                                    response to a design brief. This brief asks them, as a designer, to consider:<br><br>

                                    Students have looked at range of issues such as sustainability and rights to protest as a starting point for their designs.</p><br>
                                <p>The hair and makeup students are supporting the collections through collaboration and a shared vision through their
