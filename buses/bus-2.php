                                <p>There will be collaboration between Fashion 2nd year students and Hairdressing/Make up: Students are working together to develop looks for a catwalk to showcase their skills. Fashion students have been asked to design a promotional and Ready to Wear range based on a concept developed in response to a design brief. This brief asks them, as a designer, to consider what makes them angry. What do they feel passionate about? What do they want to change in contemporary society? How could they voice their opinions using fashion? How can they make a difference? Students have looked at range of issues such as sustainability and rights to protest as a starting point for their designs. The Hair and MakeUp students are supporting the collections through collaboration and a shared vision through their styling of the models.</p>
